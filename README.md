## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo** and run `npm install`.
2. **Setup Supabase**:
   - Create a project on [Supabase Console](https://supabase.com/).
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password).
   - Create an `orders` table and a `photos` storage bucket.
   - Copy your config to `.env` (use `.env.example` as a template).
3. **Setup Razorpay**:
   - Get your Test/Live Key ID from [Razorpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/).
   - Add it to your `.env` file.
4. **Admin Access**:
   - To access the admin dashboard, create a user with the email `karampreets090@gmail.com` (as per the logic in `AuthContext.jsx`) or update the logic in the context file.
5. **Run Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Folder Structure
- `src/components`: Reusable UI elements.
- `src/pages`: Main application screens.
- `src/firebase`: Firebase configuration and utilities.
- `src/context`: Auth and Cart state management.
- `src/styles`: Global CSS and design system.
- `src/utils`: Helper functions and static data.

## Note on Razorpay
This MVP uses the standard frontend Razorpay integration. For production, it is highly recommended to implement server-side order creation using a Node.js/Express backend to ensure payment security.
